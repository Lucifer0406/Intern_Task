This task demonstrates how to apply a custom transformation on a DataFrame using pandas. 
A small dataset of employees with their departments and salaries is created. 
A normalization function is defined and applied to salaries within each department using groupby and apply. 
The result adds a new column with normalized salary values, showing how data can be processed group-wise.
